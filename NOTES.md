### Initial Set up

1. Created folder on local computer
2. Opened terminal
3. Run `npx create-react-app repo-name` in terminal
4. Run`cd repo-name` in terminal
5. Run `code .` in terminal to open repository in VS CODE if this is your editor, otherwise utilize terminal command appropriately matching your editor of choice.
6. Run `git init` in terminal
7. Run `git remote add origin https://github.com/your_github_username/your_repo_name` in terminal
8. Run `git add .` in terminal to add initial set up files
9. Run `git commit -m 'Your commit message'`
10. Run `git push -u origin master` in terminal
11. Run `Run npm install react-canvas-draw`
 (however, I ran into issues so per the git errand, I ran
 
 `npm install react-canvas-draw --legacy-peer-deps`
 
 and it worked.)
